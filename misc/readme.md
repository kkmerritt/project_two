# TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:
  Session Syntax, Switching to local variables.
  Had a router working but started encountering a lot of little bugs. Revered to just using server.
  A tremendously hard time pushing req.session info into my meta-schemas. Turned out
    to be mostly syntax issues though. HA! I hate myself....

# TECHNICAL ASPECTS / FEATURES / FUNCTIONALITY
  created a stupid logger.
  created meta schema models.
  logins are permanent.
  sessions are destroyed at new user.
  new user's must have proper credentials (email, password, avatar)
  fairly responsive

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
  give it more of a purpose.
  remove bulky bootstrap code.
  improve cross-platform responsiveness
  fix the user comments
  ...turn the link to my 'professional' links black and white?
